                        This project aims to leverage the infrastructure of Siamese to make code clone search using code vector representation (a vector created from a given code snippet) scalable to large code base such as Stack Overflow or GitHub. <br />

                        non-Pythonic code snippets, but also to recommend how to transform a non-idiomatic code into
                        a Pythonic idiom one.

                      <b>Are developers aware of clones when they make code changes?</b><br />
                      This projects aim to leverage the rich information in code review process and
                      automatic code clone detection to assess the awareness of developers to code
                      cloning on a day-to-day basis. Code clone detection will be performed before
                      and after each code review patch is submitted. With detected clones, code changes
                      from the patch, and natural language text in the review, we can ask several
                      interesting questions by performing a manual analysis of the results:
                      (1) How often are developers aware, i.e., do they discuss them in code review,
                      when clones are introduced into the systems? (2) When they discuss about clones,
                      what happens to the clones in the system after the discussion?
                      (3) What are common intents when developers introduce clones into the software?
                      (4) What is the developer's perception about code clones? Should clones
                      always be removed or it's just good to know they're there?
                      This works has a possibility to collaborate with CREST researchers.

                      <b>Code clone detection using coding style</b><br />
                      Base on the naturalness of software, it might be possible that a programmer's coding style can be an indicator
                      of code copying and pasting. This project aims to investigate the potential application of applying coding style
                      detection to code clone detection problem. One has to work finding a technique to identify coding style of a given
                      software project, and then detect the newly submitted patch to see if the code conforms to the project's coding style.

                      <b>Automated software license identification using deep learning techniques</b><br />
                      This project focuses on training a deep learning model to predict software license based on its license text.
                      The benefits of the project include the analysis of software licenses on GitHub and
                      automatic detection of software license conflicts.

                      <b>Automated testing for 3D games</b><br />
                      Testing framework for games is still underexplored. We aim to facilitate the tedious task of game testing
                      by developing automated testing techniques specifically for 3D games. There is a possibility to adopt search-based testing techniques
                      succesfully applied to traditional software on games.
