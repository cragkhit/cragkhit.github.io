                      on the following topics (or any topic of your interest). Please feel free to contact me directly.

                      <b>Code Clone Search as a Service (CCSaS)</b><br />
                      This project aims to leverage the scalability of Elasticsearch to scale up Siamese to the cloud as a code
                      clone search service, where one can upload a project or give a link to a GitHub project and CCSaS will automatically
                      detect clones in the given project. I receive $20,000 Amazon AWS credits for this research to there are machines available for you
                      to try it out!
                    </p>

                      <b>Extension to Siamese</b><br />
                      The Siamese clone search engine currently support only Java, but I am determined to extend the tool to support more languages.

                      <b>Code clone detection using coding style</b><br />
                      Base on the naturalness of software, it might be possible that a programmer's coding style can be an indicator
                      of code copying and pasting. This project aims to investigate the potential application of applying coding style
                      detection to code clone detection problem. One has to work finding a technique to identify coding style of a given
                      software project, and then detect the newly submitted patch to see if the code conforms to the project's coding style.

                      <b>Automated software license identification using deep learning techniques</b><br />
                      This project focuses on training a deep learning model to predict software license based on its license text.
                      The benefits of the project include the analysis of software licenses on GitHub and
                      automatic detection of software license conflicts.

                      <b>Virtual reality-based software visualisation</b><br />
                      I am interested in explore an application of the latest VR technology to visualise software projects to help the programmers
                      understand their software better.

                      <b>Automated testing for 3D games</b><br />
                      Testing framework for games is still underexplored. We aim to facilitate the tedious task of game testing
                      by developing testing techniques specifically for 3D games. There is a possibility to adopt search-based testing techniques
                      succesfuly applied to traditional software on games.
